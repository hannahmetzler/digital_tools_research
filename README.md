## Introduction

In this one-day training, we will provide insights and hands-on experience for digital methods that are used for a broad range of activities in daily research practice.

The Skills Training is structured into four major areas of activity that researcher’s engage in in their daily practice:

* Digitally enhanced literature search and management
* Digital collaborations
* Doing (reproducible) research: Documentation & licenses
* New forms of publication

Every topic will feature an introduction into the challenges and possibilities that **digitized practices** bring in the respective area of research practice. Our experts will show examples of best practices and introduce free and **open tools** that can be used by researchers to digitally enhance their workflows and make them **efficient and transparent**. Since learning happens best through doing, this training will be very “hands on” and participants are asked to bring their **own research projects** to the training and implement workflows that they have learned about right away and in their own research context.

## Preparation for participants

To make full use of the sessions, please join the training from a computer or laptop. We will do a lot of practical exercises, which you can use to work on your own research projects. 

* If you want to follow the [literature management demonstrations](https://hannahmetzler.github.io/digital_tools_research/04_literature/index.html#1):
    * Make an account at [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [install](https://www.zotero.org/download/) Zotero (Standalone) and the Connector for the browser you usually use.
    * Make an account on [ResearchRabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com).

* If you want to follow the [good documentation practices demonstration](https://hannahmetzler.github.io/digital_tools_research/05_documentation/slides/index.html): 
    * Make an account on [OSF](https://osf.io/) (Open Science Framework) OR make an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (alternatively: if your institution hosts a GitLab instance, make an account there).
    * If you want to use the exercise for your own research: think about a project (finished or ongoing) you would like to document and bring the relevant files.
